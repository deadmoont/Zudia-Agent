Connects discussion points from the meeting directly to specific clauses within your existing legal documents.

### 💡 AI-Powered Suggestions

Automatically generates suggested revisions for document clauses based on the meeting's transcript and compliance analysis.

### 🔄 One-Click Document Updates

Empowers users to instantly review, select, and apply suggested changes directly to the clauses stored in the database.

    D --> E[Review & Apply]
    E --> F[Update Database]
```

### Workflow Steps

1. **Start a Meeting**: Begin a new session and start the "Live Transcription." Zudia+ listens and transcribes in real-time.

2. **Live Analysis**: As the meeting progresses, the "AI Analysis" module runs in the background, flagging potential compliance risks (e.g., "Termination Notice period is too long") and identifying clear "Action Items."

3. **Generate Suggestions**: After the meeting, navigate to the "Suggest Changes" feature. The AI analyzes the meeting insights and compares them to the relevant documents in your "Database Viewer," generating specific, actionable changes for your legal clauses.

4. **Review & Apply**: The system presents a list of proposed updates to your existing clauses. You can review each suggestion, select the ones you want to accept, and apply them directly to the documents.

5. **Update Database**: With one click, the accepted changes are applied, and your legal document clauses are instantly updated in the database.
